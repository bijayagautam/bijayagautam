<h2 class="page-sub-header">I’m a Designer and a Developer.</h2>
<p>I have accomplished my Bachelor’s degree of Science in Computer Information Systems from Tarleton State University, Stephenville, Texas, USA (2015) and started working as an Application and Software Developer for almost three years at different IT companies. Then, I moved to Canada in 2019 and enhanced my development skills by completing Certification in Web Design and Development (2020) and pursued Certification in Graphic Design for Print and Web (2021) where I learned vast design concepts. I am passionate about designing and building Dynamic, Clean, Responsive, Functional, and Accessible websites. I feel peaceful creating User Interface/ User Experience, Page layout, Illustrations, and Graphics such as logos and icons. I have learned diverse work culture working as a consultant with several clients like Dell, Accenture, and Wells Fargo by designing, developing, and understanding complex websites and information architecture. </p>
